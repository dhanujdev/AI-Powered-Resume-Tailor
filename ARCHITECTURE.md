## AI/ML Integration Points

### 1. Job Description Analysis

- **Technology**: LangChain + LlamaIndex
- **Purpose**: Semantic parsing of job descriptions to extract requirements
- **Implementation**:
  - LlamaIndex creates searchable knowledge base from job descriptions
  - LangChain agents perform structured information extraction
  - Domain-specific prompts identify key skills and qualifications

### 2. Resume Tailoring System

- **Technology**: OpenAI API + LangChain
- **Purpose**: Intelligently customize resume content for job matching
- **Implementation**:
  - Resume chunking and semantic analysis
  - Template-guided content generation with constraints
  - Rule-based verification of output quality

### 3. Application Form Intelligence

- **Technology**: ML-based DOM analysis
- **Purpose**: Map resume fields to application form inputs
- **Implementation**:
  - Field classification model to identify form purposes
  - Heuristic mapping between resume sections and form fields
  - Learning from user corrections to improve mapping accuracy

## Data Flow

1. **Job Scanning Phase**
   - Content script activates on job sites
   - DOM elements are parsed for job data
   - LlamaIndex creates searchable knowledge structure
   - Key information extracted using LangChain processors

2. **Resume Tailoring Phase**
   - Base resume loaded from secure storage
   - Job requirements mapped to resume sections
   - AI generates tailored content maintaining original style
   - Version control maintains history of modifications

3. **Application Automation Phase**
   - Form elements identified and classified
   - Resume sections mapped to appropriate fields
   - Confidence scoring determines automation level
   - User verification for low-confidence mappings

## Security Architecture

- **API Key Management**: Encrypted local storage with access controls
- **Data Isolation**: Personal information never leaves client device
- **Permission Model**: Minimal required permissions with explicit user grants
- **Privacy Controls**: User ownership of all data with export/delete options

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching Layer**: Previously processed job descriptions stored locally
- **Batched API Calls**: Efficient token usage for OpenAI interactions
- **Progressive Loading**: UI responsiveness during AI processing
- **Offline Capabilities**: Core functionality available without connectivity

## Testing Framework

- **Unit Tests**: Component isolation with Jest
- **Integration Tests**: Agent interaction verification
- **E2E Tests**: Puppeteer simulated user workflows
- **AI Output Validation**: Statistical evaluation of generated content

This architecture showcases modern AI application design principles with practicality, security, and performance as key considerations.
